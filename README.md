# Neural-Net-for-Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients
 - Implemented Neural Network code from ground up in python
 	- To understand hyper parameters
 	- To understand math involved in NN
 - Implemented a Cross Validation Function for Neural Netwrok but is generic in terms of choosing parameters
 	- Helps in understanding how differnt paramters help and change the accuracy
 - Code is generic and can be used to create DNN but it is not advised to do so as this is not parallel
 - Implemented both Linear model and Non linear model for NN
 - Impemented for both Classification data and Regression data.


## Data Set Used:
<b>Default of credit card clients</b><br>

## Neural Network:
- Created a NN in python and used it for classification
- Also, used tensorflow to test many different structures each have more than 5 layers
